# What is this repository about?
Here, we are bringing renderings and coding together. You find here examples of Python scripts to quickly create illustrations and 3D-models.

Drawing illustrations and creating 3D-models is challenging but rewarding. Using Python to automate tedious, repetitive tasks helps making art and renderings quicker. It also allows for a different approache, giving us the possibility to create new and exciting results.

## Inkscape scripts
The Inkscape extension `Simple Inkscape Scripting` enables us to use most of Inkscapes functionalities in a Python script. Doing so, speeds up the creation of GIFs and by usign variables it makes the final product more versatile. For example, changing the color, size, or number of images is only one change away.

## Blender scripts
Blender itself uses Python and it is therefore not dependent on a third-party API.
